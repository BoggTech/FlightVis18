# FlightVis
Program designed for visualizing flight data in Processing 4.

**Prerequisites**

Geomerative: http://www.ricardmarxer.com/geomerative/ (Extract folder contents into your Libraries folder.)

SQLite jdbc: https://github.com/xerial/sqlite-jdbc/releases (Download appropriate .jar, drag into the processing project window to automatically install, then restart processing)

---------------

NOTE: Data file is too large to have on github. Please download it manually and add it to your "data" directory:

Let it overwrite any flights.db that may exist in your version of the software due to opening it.
